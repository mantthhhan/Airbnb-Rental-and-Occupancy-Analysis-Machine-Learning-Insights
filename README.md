# Airbnb-Rental-and-Occupancy-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Insights
A machine learning &amp; data visualization project analyzing Airbnb pricing and occupancy trends in NYC. Features data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, predictive modeling (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression), and an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard.  

🚀 Tech: **Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn, Plotly**

**Project Overview:**
I developed a data-driven analysis and predictive modeling pipeline to study Airbnb rental prices and occupancy trends in New York City. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to uncover key factors influencing Airbnb pricing and availability.

I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, followed by EDA to visualize trends in pricing, occupancy rates, and neighborhood distribution. Using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, I built predictive models to estimate rental prices based on location, room type, and availability.

Additionally, I created interactive visualizations and dashboards using Plotly and Dash, allowing users to explore Airbnb trends dynamically. This project provides valuable insights into pricing optimization, occupancy strategies, and investment opportunities.

**Project Synopsis:**
I developed a comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling pipeline for Airbnb rental prices and occupancy trends using machine learning and data visualization.

**Key steps include:**

✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables

✅ **EDA & Visualization** – Explored pricing trends and occupancy rates using Seaborn & Matplotlib

✅ **Feature Engineering** – Created new features like availability ratio & customer segments

✅ **Predictive Modeling** – Built Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models

✅ **Dashboard & Visualization** – Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly & Dash

✅ **Insights & Recommendations** – Provided pricing optimization strategies & investment insights

This project enables Airbnb hosts, investors, and analysts to make data-driven decisions about pricing, demand, and market positioning.

Results of Analysis: Airbnb Rental & Occupancy Trends
After performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, I derived key insights regarding Airbnb rental pricing and occupancy rates in New York City:

1️⃣ **Pricing Trends & Neighborhood Impact**

📌 Manhattan & Brooklyn have the highest rental prices, with Manhattan leading in luxury listings.

📌 Queens and the Bronx offer budget-friendly options, but with lower demand and occupancy.

📌 Hypothesis testing (t-test) confirmed that Manhattan’s prices are significantly higher than Brooklyn’s.

2️⃣ **Room Type & Price Correlation**

🏠 Entire home/apartment listings are the most expensive, with significantly higher prices than shared/private rooms.

🏠 Private rooms are mid-range, while shared rooms are the least expensive and less common.

🏠 Higher availability does not always mean lower prices, as high-demand locations still maintain high rental rates.

3️⃣ **Factors Affecting Occupancy Rates**

📊 Listings with higher number of reviews and positive ratings tend to have better occupancy rates.

📊 Short-term rental availability (365 days open) is often linked with higher competition in pricing.

📊 Minimum nights requirement impacts occupancy – listings with longer minimum stays often see fewer bookings.

4️⃣ **Predictive Modeling Results**

🤖 Random Forest Regression outperformed other models, achieving higher R² scores and lower RMSE, indicating strong predictive capability.

📉 Linear Regression struggled to capture nonlinear relationships, leading to lower accuracy.

🌳 Decision Tree Regression performed moderately well, but was prone to overfitting.

5️⃣ **Investment & Strategy Recommendations**

✅ For Hosts: Setting competitive prices based on neighborhood trends and offering short-term stays can boost occupancy.

✅ For Investors: Brooklyn and Queens show potential for budget investments with high demand for mid-range stays.

✅ For Airbnb Management: Listings should focus on optimizing reviews, availability, and pricing to maximize revenue.

This analysis provides data-backed insights for pricing optimization, strategic listing management, and investment decision-making in the Airbnb rental market. 🚀
